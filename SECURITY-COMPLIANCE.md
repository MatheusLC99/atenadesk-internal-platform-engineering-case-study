# Security & Compliance

## Data Protection Principles

- No customer data is exposed publicly
- No internal URLs, tokens, secrets, or environment variables are published
- No database connection strings or credentials are included
- No proprietary schemas or field-level structures are disclosed beyond generic modeling

## Redaction Rules for Screenshots

If screenshots are included, they must:
- blur names, emails, phone numbers, IDs, addresses, ticket contents
- blur any metrics or dashboards that could reveal business performance
- remove sidebar items that mention internal tools/projects by name (if sensitive)

## Safe-to-Share Content

This repo focuses on:
- architecture boundaries
- decision-making and trade-offs
- generic UX flows
- technology stack
- domain modeling (high level)
