# Problem Statement

Before AtenaDesk, internal workflows were fragmented:

## Client Registration
Client data lived in a paid third-party tool with limited flexibility and poor UX.
No consistent validation or required fields existed internally.

## Requests / Tickets
Client requests arrived via calls or emails and were tracked inconsistently:
- handwritten notes
- personal files
- ad-hoc forwarding to engineering
This led to lost requests and delayed execution.

## Knowledge Base
Support documentation was decentralized:
each support agent maintained their own notes and files without a standard format,
causing inconsistency and slower onboarding.

## License Operations
License-related controls were centralized in a single senior developer account,
creating bottlenecks and operational risk.

AtenaDesk was built to solve these constraints with a single internal platform.
